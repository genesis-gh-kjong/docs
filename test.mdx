# Introduction

## Overview

### What Genbots Can Do For You

Genesis offers AI workers, known as Genbots, capable of autonomously performing entry-level tasks. You can personalize these Genbots to undertake additional job functions tailored to your needs. With secure access to enterprise systems, documents, data, and collaboration tools like Slack, Genbots work alongside human colleagues and other bots. Natively, they utilize Snowflake Cortex and the family of models supported, as well as the option to use external AI models to deliver high-quality, grounded, LLM, and data analysis workloads.

To streamline operations, Genbots manage all input/output processes, task execution, tool generation, data access, and document handling. They also support role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring secure and compliant interactions. Continuous learning mechanisms allow Genbots to adapt and improve over time, while built-in features for compliance and cost management ensure they are cost-effective. This guide will show you how to activate and configure your Genbots, enabling you to enhance productivity and automate routine tasks efficiently.

On Slack, Genbots automatically receive a summary of the thread they join, so you won’t need to recap the conversation.

### Eve: Mother of GenBots

Eve can build, deploy, and monitor other Genbots. She has access to special tools and data to ensure that the Genbots she creates are performing optimally. She can also customize bots to fulfill specific tasks, such as managing data, automating processes, or analyzing information.

**Creating GenBots**

To create a Genbot, you need to @mention Eve and ask her to create a Genbot with your persona of choice.

**Confirm Details & Grant Access**

Eve will then ask you to review the details, and upon your confirmation, she will begin the creation process. After creation, she will ask you to provide the “App Level Token.” You can directly ask her to request this token from the team member who has the authority and access.

Your team member will receive a message like this from Eve through direct messages.
